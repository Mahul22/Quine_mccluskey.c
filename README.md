Implementation of Quine Mccluskey method in the C programming language 
Quine-McCluskey is a method used for simplifying Boolean expressions. In C programming, one can implement the Quine-McCluskey algorithm to minimize logical functions. The algorithm works by combining adjacent terms with a specific number of differing bits to create prime implicants, which are then used to find essential prime implicants for the final minimized expression.
